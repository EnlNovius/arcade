Step 10 - Multiple Levels and Other Layers
------------------------------------------

Here's an expanded example:

* This adds foreground, background, and "Don't Touch" layers.

  * The background tiles appear behind the player
  * The foreground appears in front of the player
  * The Don't Touch layer will reset the player to the start (218-231)

* The player resets to the start if they fall off the map (207-216)
* If the player gets to the right side of the map, the program attempts to load another layer

  * Add ``level`` attribute (73-74)
  * Updated ``setup`` to load a file based on the level (81-101, specifically lines 81 and 85)
  * Added end-of-map check(233-244)
