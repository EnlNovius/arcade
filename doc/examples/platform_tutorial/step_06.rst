Step 6 - Add Scrolling
----------------------

We can have our window be a small viewport into a much larger world by adding
scrolling.

The viewport margins control how close you can get to the edge of the screen
before the camera starts scrolling.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../arcade/examples/platform_tutorial/06_scrolling.py
    :caption: Add Scrolling
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 20-25, 47-49, 133-175

.. note::

    Work at changing the viewport margins to something that you like.
